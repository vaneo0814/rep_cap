            What drives content marketing salaries today?

            It turns out, being a great writer, editor or designer may be the
            most common entry point for content marketing careers, but data
            analytics and content strategy skills are the tickets to earning a
            higher content marketing salary.

          <p class="second-txt-left-col">
            Content marketing is a complex — and still emerging — discipline. We
            wanted to better understand these changing dynamics, so we launched
            the Managing Editor career survey in 2020 and invited content
            marketers to share more about their responsibilities at work, their
            pay and bonuses, their career experiences and ambitions, and the
            tools they use to manage their projects. In total, 387 content
            marketers participated in the 2022 survey, including people working
            in B2C, B2B, nonprofit and government roles. The vast majority of
            respondents live in the U.S.

              <p>
                B2B marketers reported higher earnings on the whole than their
                B2C peers and were more likely to be eligible for a bonus.

              <h6>Where Writing Meets Data</h6>
              <p>
                Data analytics was among the least favorite job responsibilities
                among respondents — but also one of the skills most correlated
                with higher earnings.

            <li>
              <h6>Putting in Some Long Hours</h6>
              <p>
                A majority reported working 41+ hours. Many of those working 51+
                hours are the top earners surveyed.
              </p>

            <li>
              <h6>Mostly Working at Home</h6>
              <p>
                77% reported working remotely full-time, compared to 26% last
                year.
